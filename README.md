# Yet Another SICP Answers Collection

This is my personal SICP answers collection. I will hopefully finish most of the exercises in this year(2017).

The interpreter I use is Racket under R5RS setting. I also use the SICP collection library for the sake of implementing some specific problems. 

Chapter one is relatively easy so I skipped many questions.

Here are the exercises which I think is enlightening:

| number | content                                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 2.6    | Church numerals                          |
| 2.32   | all subsets of a set                     |
| 2.35   | count leaves of a tree using fold-right abstraction |
| 2.38   | right fold and left fold                 |
| 2.42   | 8-Queens Problem                         |
| 3.19   | Floyd Cycle Detection Algorithm          |
